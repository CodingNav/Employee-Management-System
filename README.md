## About 
<i><b>Employee Management System</b></i> is a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases, like in this employee management system. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS).
